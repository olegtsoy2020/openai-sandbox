Creating a sample application to work with OpenAI's GPT-4 involves a few steps, mainly setting up an environment where you can send queries to the GPT-4 API and process its responses. 
Below, I’ll walk you through building a simple Python application that interacts with GPT-4.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, ensure you have Python installed. Python 3.6 or newer is recommended. 
You’ll also need pip to install Python packages.

## Step 2: Install Required Packages

You’ll need to install the openai Python package, which provides a convenient way to interact with the API. 

Install it using pip: `pip install openai`

## Step 3: Get Your API Key

To use OpenAI’s API, you need an API key. 

If you don’t already have one, you can obtain it by signing up for an account at OpenAI.

## Step 4: Run Python Application

`python chat_with_gpt.py`
